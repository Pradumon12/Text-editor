# Text-editor
A simple text editor using the Tkinter library in Python.</br>
# Install Tkinter
```
pip install tk
```
It creates a main window with a text field that has a vertical scrollbar, and sets up four menus (File, Edit, Format, and Help) using functions from separate modules. The text editor can respond to user events, such as clicking on a menu item or typing in the text field. When the program is run, the main window is displayed and the Tkinter event loop waits for user input.
